#Schema

This Sinatra app has a database with the following schema. 

![](README_imgs/schema.png)

##This is a two part drill 

1. Create ActiveRecord associations to match this schema. 
2. In the console, use the console to test if every one of your associations are correct. 

##There are two goals for this setup:
1. Convince yourself that you know how to test if you've set up the assocations correctly via the console.
2. Drill until assocations are muscle memory. 



#Setup: 

In the folder ActiveRecord_Associations_Drill_Skeleton, run the following commands.

```
  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate
```

You are now setup to be able to add ActiveRecord Associations.
